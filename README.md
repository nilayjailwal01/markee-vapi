# markee-vapi
Transforming end2end campaign management using 24*7 Voice agents helping campaign managers take right decisions discussing with an agent.

We are excited to present our entry for the #BuildForVapi challenge — MARKEE, an Intelligent Performance Marketing Platform built on the capabilities of Vapi. We have designed this solution to transform how Campaign Managers operate by introducing an AI-powered, agentic workflow integrated with Vapi’s voice agent that brings synchronization and clarity across the entire campaign management lifecycle.
In the current landscape, Campaign Managers often face delays in getting strategic clarity or answers to their data-related queries. They are forced to navigate multiple tools and coordinate with several teams such as Data & Analytics, Channel Managers, Product Owners, Audience Insights, and Creative Agencies. MARKEE eliminates this complexity by acting as a unified layer where campaign operations can be managed seamlessly through natural voice interactions. With this platform, Campaign Managers no longer need to understand every detail of the underlying Martech stack or spend hours on redundant manual tasks. Instead, they can channel their time and energy into high-value activities like brainstorming and strategy development — simply by using their voice.
MARKEE is an enterprise-level solution, and as part of its build, we have incorporated certain restricted packages and UI components to meet internal compliance and security standards.  As a result, public access to the live solution is limited to preserve these enterprise-level constraints. We have deployed the code internally on a secure domain; therefore, to run it locally, the codebase can be downloaded and used. However, we would be more than happy to offer a detailed walkthrough and share the workings of the UI with the Vapi team or other genuine stakeholders interested in the solution.
